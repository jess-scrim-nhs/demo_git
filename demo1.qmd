# Introduction

Welcome to this Quarto demo! Quarto is a powerful tool for creating dynamic documents, presentations, and websites. In this demo, I'm going to cover some basic features.

## Code Chunks

You can include code chunks in various coding languages. Here's an example of an R code chunk:

```{r}
# This is an R code chunk
summary(cars)

```

```{r}
# This R chunk makes a graph
plot(cars)
```

But we can also code in python:

```{python}
# This is a Python code chunk
import numpy as np
print(np.mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))

```

```{python}
# This Python chunk makes a graph
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
plt.show()

```

## Reports

The markdown element of Quarto allows you to format text with *italic emphasis* and **bold emphasis**. You can also add superscripts^2^, subscripts~2~, and display in-text code `verbatim`. You can also ~~strikethrough~~ text and present it in [small caps]{.smallcaps}.

You can embed [links with names](https://quarto.org/), direct urls like <https://quarto.org/>, and links to [other places]() in the document.

### Technical Writing

The area of a circle is $A = \pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius and $\pi$ is the constant $3.141592\ldots$

A larger equation:

$$
f(x)={\sqrt{\frac{\tau}{2\pi}}}
      e^{-\tau (x-\mu )^{2}/2}
$$

### Images

The syntax for inserting links is similar for embedding an inline image: ![render icon](images/dhcw.png){#fig-nadolig width="20%"}.

Or images as block element...

![NADOLIG](images/dog2.png){width="100%"}

You can change the position of these images:

![Smaller Right NADOLIG](images/dog3.png){#fig-nadolig-small-right fig-align="right" width="50%"}

Can do the same for figures:

```{r}
#| label: fig-palmer
#| fig-cap: "**Figure about Bills of Palmer Penguins** "
#| fig-subcap: 
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-align: left
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-width: 5

library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = bill_length_mm,
           y = bill_depth_mm,
           col = island)) +
  geom_point()
```
